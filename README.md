The Enron scandal, publicized in October 2001, led to the bankruptcy of the Enron Corporation, an American energy company based in Houston, Texas, and the de facto dissolution of Arthur Andersen, which was one of the five largest audit and accountancy partnerships in the world.

The goal of this project is to use Eron's employee dataset and machine learning methods to identify the people of interest in Enron Fraud.

Please refer to "Enron Fraud Prediction Project.ipynb" for my Python code and detailed prediction process.
